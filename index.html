                <h2>My Drawings</h2>
                
                <p>I have plenty of drawings to share! Mainly I draw portaits but I'm branching out to landscapes and animals.
                Another thing is that I love bright colors. For traditional drawing I mainly use brush pens, alcohol markers, pencils, and watercolor markers.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Some painting I did while I was in college. This was a lot of work because I never tried oil painting before this class so this was quite the challenge. </p>
